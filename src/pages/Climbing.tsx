                I love climbing, especially bouldering and trad climbing. I enjoy the challenge of solving problems and pushing my limits.
                You can find some of my climbing achievements on my <a href="https://www.mountainproject.com/user/201304798/josh-richardson">Mountain Project</a> account.

                I started climbing in the summer of 2016 and have been hooked ever since. Shorty after I started climbing I joined a
                competitive youth team at my local climbing gym. Here I learned the fundamentals of climbing and how to solve problems.
                Once I aged out of competing at a youth level I started climbing outdoors where I found a new appreciation for the outdoors and climbing.
